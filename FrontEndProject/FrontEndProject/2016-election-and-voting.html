            Why should I vote?
            There’s lots of reasons to vote. One that’s crucial is that the more that people in similar communities vote, the less likely their communities are to be ignored by the people who make the laws.
            
            A report from Demos puts it like this: the needs of lower-voting populations are almost entirely ignored in elections and policymaking, in no small part because they are missing at the polls. Thus, clearly and urgently, we need to close the voting gaps to ensure greater balance in electoral and policy outcomes, so that all Americans, not just affluent white Americans, may enjoy the fruits of democracy.  
            
            Another reason to vote is that the people we put in office are constantly making decisions that impact all of our daily lives, whether we know it or not. It’s important to make sure those people are the ones we choose, not the ones that we let others choose for us.
            
            What is a political party?
            A political party is an organized group of people with similar political opinions who work together to win elections. Political parties compete against one another for political power and the ability to influence and pass public policy. In the United States, the two most prominent political parties are the Democratic and Republican parties. Besides those two, there are lots of other parties that many people identify with.
            
            What does “race” mean in election lingo?
            Essentially, elections are contests between multiple people who all want the same job. Each contest is called a race.
            
            What do they mean by”the polls” or a “polling place”?
            The word “poll” has multiple definitions. One is a survey that campaigns use to find out what the public thinks of them or issues. When talking about election day, “the polls” or “polling place” is where people go to vote. “When you go to the polls” is another way of saying “when you go vote.”
            
            Voting seems confusing and intimidating. Where do I start?
            1. Read through all the resources on this page.
            2. Get registered to vote.
            3. Make sure you have an acceptable photo ID. You’ll need to bring it with you when you vote.
            4. Learn about the candidates and where they stand on the issues that matter to you.
            5. Have a voting plan in place before election day. Where is your polling place? How will you get there? How long will it take? If you have kids, will you bring them? These are factors you need to consider. And be sure to tell your employer at least a day in advance that you need off if you have to vote during working hours.

            What is a primary election?
            There are two main types of elections: primaries and generals.
            
            Primary: A primary is an election that happens before the general. Think of them as the “semi-finals.” The goal of a primary election is to narrow the field of candidates that voters will have to choose from during the general election. Though the primary elections don’t determine the final result, they are one of the most important parts of an election. The winners of the primary elections run against each other in the general election.
            General: The election where the winner of the race is finally chosen.
            
            Wisconsin has important rules about primary elections. Read about them here.
            
            What are the 2016 election day dates?
            1. February 16: voters will select the top 2 candidates for Wisconsin Supreme Court and for any local and county races with more than 2 contenders.
            2.  April 5: we will elect the final winner for those contests, and vote in the presidential primary.
            3. August 9: the fall partisan primary for U.S. Congress and the Wisconsin state legislature.
            4. November 8: we will elect the next president, and our state and federal representatives.
            
            Why should I vote in all these elections when the only one that matters is the presidential race in November?
            Local politics matter! While choosing the next president is important, the president has to work with 535 different Congresspeople from all 50 states. Who the Congresspeople are from your state is determined by your vote.
            
            The president doesn’t determine how much money to invest in your neighborhood’s public school or what the minimum wage in Wisconsin should be. The president doesn’t decide how much of the county budget is devoted to public safety or public transit. If your street needs a stoplight, you don’t call the president. There are lots of local issues decided by local elected officials.
