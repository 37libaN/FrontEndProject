                <h2>Why should I vote?</h2>
                <p>There’s lots of reasons to vote. One that’s crucial is that the more that people in similar
                    communities vote, the less likely their communities are to be ignored by the people who make the
                    laws.

                    A report from Demos puts it like this: the needs of lower-voting populations are almost entirely
                    ignored in elections and policymaking, in no small part because they are missing at the polls. Thus,
                    clearly and urgently, we need to close the voting gaps to ensure greater balance in electoral and
                    policy outcomes, so that all Americans, not just affluent white Americans, may enjoy the fruits of
                    democracy.

                    Another reason to vote is that the people we put in office are constantly making decisions that
                    impact all of our daily lives, whether we know it or not. It’s important to make sure those people
                    are the ones we choose, not the ones that we let others choose for us.

                <h2>What is a political party?</h2>
                <p> A political party is an organized group of people with similar political opinions who work together
                    to win elections. Political parties compete against one another for political power and the ability
                    to influence and pass public policy. In the United States, the two most prominent political parties
                    are the Democratic and Republican parties. Besides those two, there are lots of other parties that
                    many people identify with.

                    is called a race.</p>

                <p> The word “poll” has multiple definitions. One is a survey that campaigns use to find out what the
                    public thinks of them or issues. When talking about election day, “the polls” or “polling place” is
                    where people go to vote. “When you go to the polls” is another way of saying “when you go vote.”

                        <li>Have a voting plan in place before election day. Where is your polling place? How will you

                            there? How long will it take? If you have kids, will you bring them? These are factors you
                            need to
                            consider. And be sure to tell your employer at least a day in advance that you need off if

                <h2>What is a primary election?</h2>
                <p>There are two main types of elections: primaries and generals.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Primary: A primary is an election that happens before the general. Think of them as the
                            “semi-finals.” The goal
                            of a primary election is to narrow the field of candidates that voters will have to choose
                            from during the
                            general election. Though the primary elections don’t determine the final result, they are
                            one of the most
                            important parts of an election. The winners of the primary elections run against each other
                            in the general
                            election.</li>
                        <li>General: The election where the winner of the race is finally chosen.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Wisconsin has important rules about primary elections. <a

                <h2>Why should I vote in all these elections when the only one that matters is the presidential race in
                    November?</h2>
                <p>
                    Local politics matter! While choosing the next president is important, the president has to work
                    with 535
                    different Congresspeople from all 50 states. Who the Congresspeople are from your state is
                    determined by your
                    vote.</p>
                <p> The president doesn’t determine how much money to invest in your neighborhood’s public school or
                    what the
                    minimum wage in Wisconsin should be. The president doesn’t decide how much of the county budget is
                    devoted to
                    public safety or public transit. If your street needs a stoplight, you don’t call the president.
                    There are lots
                    of local issues decided by local elected officials.</p>
